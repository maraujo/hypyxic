# The Hypyxic package

Hypyxic is a python code to compute sleep apnea specific hypoxic burden (SASHB) from oxygen desaturation signal and sleep data. 

## About
This package was based on Matlab implementation of Hypoxic Burden made by Philip de Chazal at https://github.com/pdechazal/Hypoxic-Burden. 

This code was written by Matheus Araujo, more info at: https://www.matheusaraujo.com/.

This code is suppose to be a full open-source alternative to compute sleep apnea specific hypoxic burden (SASHB), since Matlab is not completely open-source.

## Installation

1. Download the file hypyxic.py to the same folder that you run you Python script

## Test

```bash
python test_hypyxic.py
```
If the argument **to_plot** is **True** you will get this chart also:
![plot](example_plot.png?raw=true "Plot Generated by Hypyxic code")

## Usage

```python
from hypyxic import compute_hypoxic_burden
hypoxic_burden = compute_hypoxic_burden(sp02_signal, sp02_sr, sleep_stage_annotation, sleep_stage_sr, resp_events_start, resp_events_duration, to_plot=False)
```
## Warning

This implementation output on the test data is **19.361256096995703**, the original matlab output is **19.433**.
Use at your own risk.

The reason of this difference is that MATLAB code is **not** 100% convertible to python, since MATLAB is a closed source enviroment. In particular, funcions like findpeaks are **not** 100% the same.
